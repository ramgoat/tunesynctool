# tunesynctool

A self-hostable service to transfer (and sync*) music between your local/commercial streaming services.

*work in progress, not yet available

Tunesynctool supports the following services:
- Spotify
- Deezer (read only, authentication is not currently supported, thus only public playlists can be accessed in read only mode)
- Any Subsonic-like service (Navidrome, Airsonic, etc.)
- YouTube Music

Support for other services is planned, however the current focus is on getting the self-hostable service to a stable state.

## Docker Compose Project (RG Edit)

Env file:
```
APP_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:8080 # Frontend port
SUBSONIC_BASE_URL=https://listen.ramgoat.ca
SUBSONIC_PORT=443
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=f62***0df # 'Navidrome' app in Spotify Developers
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=70a***f99 # 'Spotify App Secret: Navidrome' item in 1Password
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- A `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable is not supported.  It's generated from `APP_HOST` and `API_BASE_URL` (the latter has an app-specified default that doesn't need to be changed)

## Stability

The project is under heavy development and contains bugs. Use at your own discretion.

## Usage

Currently you have to install the Python dependencies within requirements.txt and you'll be able to run the backend.

## Configuration

Configuration options can be loaded from the environment or be manually specified in code. [Check here](https://github.com/WilliamNT/tunesynctool/wiki/Configuration) for more information.

# FAQ

## Why aren't there any updates to the CLI or Python package, even though the repository is active?
I decided that I'd prefer to develop a self-hostable application instead for various reasons that I detailed in a wiki article.

## Does tunesynctool offer functionality to download or stream music?
**No**, use the official clients' offline listening features for that, or source your music in other ways you prefer ;)

## How does matching work?

Learn more about matching [here](https://github.com/WilliamNT/tunesynctool/wiki/Track-matching).

## When will the self-hostable app be released?
I can't tell you that unfortunately. I am working on this project in my free time and due to studies and personal matters I have to pause development often.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
